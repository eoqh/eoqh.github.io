## INJ 3.0 Upgrade: A Deflationary Revolution  

The INJ 3.0 upgrade, ratified by 99.99% community approval, marks a pivotal shift in Injectiveâ€™s economic model. By systematically reducing token supply over 18 months, the protocol aims to position INJ as one of the most deflationary assets in crypto.  

> **"INJ 3.0â€™s supply reduction will transform Injective into a hyper-deflationary asset, driving value accrual for holders,"**

This mechanism aligns with historical trends where supply shocks correlate with price appreciation. For example, Bitcoinâ€™s halving events have consistently preceded bull markets.  

### Supply Reduction Mechanics  
- **Burn Rate**: Quarterly token burns based on protocol fees.  
- **Vesting Adjustments**: Delayed unlocks for early investors.  
- **Staking Incentives**: Higher rewards for long-term stakers.
