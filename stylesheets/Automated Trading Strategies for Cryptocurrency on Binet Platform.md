# Automated Trading Strategies for Cryptocurrency on Binet Platform  

Cryptocurrency trading has evolved with automated tools designed to optimize profits and minimize risks. This guide explores Binet's trading strategy features, focusing on data-driven and sequence-based approaches to build effective crypto trading strategies.  

## Understanding Trading Strategy Modes  

Binet offers two primary modes for creating automated trading strategies: **Big Data Mode** and **Sequence Mode**. Each caters to different risk profiles and investment goals while maintaining compatibility with various crypto trading bots.  

### Big Data Mode (Single-Coin Automation)  

This fully automated approach creates strategies based on market volatility patterns. Users input their total budget for a specific cryptocurrency to generate tailored trading plans.  

#### Strategy Types  

| Strategy | Timeframe | Minimum Investment | Profit Range | Cycle Frequency |  
|---------|----------|--------------------|-------------|----------------|  
| Conservative | Monthly | 630 USDT | 10-20% | 1-2 trades |  
| Steady | Weekly | 550 USDT | 3-20% | 1-5 trades |  
| Aggressive | Daily | 2,515 USDT | 3-21% | 1-10 trades |  

**Budget-Friendly Options**  
- **1000U Starter**: Requires 700-1,000 USDT total budget, allocates 140 USDT per coin across 8 assets  
- **2000U Builder**: Requires 1,500-2,000 USDT total budget, allocates 195 USDT per coin across 10 assets

### Sequence Mode (Semi-Automatic Strategy)  

This flexible approach calculates investment sequences based on mathematical patterns. Users adjust parameters to suit their risk tolerance:  

1. **Martingale (1-2-4-6-8-10...)**  
   - High-profit potential with larger capital requirements  
   - Recommended for volatile assets with >30% drawdown resistance  

2. **Fibonacci (1-1-2-3-5-8-13...)**  
   - Balanced risk/reward profile  
   - Lower capital requirement compared to Martingale  

3. **Lucas (1-3-4-7-11-18...)**  
   - Mid-range capital requirement  
   - Faster profit realization than Fibonacci  

4. **Arithmetic (10-11-12-13-14-15...)**  
   - Customizable step sizes (minimum 50% of initial investment)  
   - Suitable for budget-conscious traders  

5. **Flat (1-1-1-1-1...)**  
   - Lowest capital requirement  
   - Limited profit potential without grid trading activation  

## Strategy Execution Mechanics  

The trading bot follows a systematic approach to maximize returns while managing risks:  

### Trading Cycle Process  
1. **Initial Purchase**: Executes first trade at set investment amount  
2. **Profit Taking**: Applies either:  
   - **Global Take Profit** (5% with 2% tracking OR 3% with 1% tracking)  
   - **Grid Take Profit** (3-5% with 1-2% tracking)  
3. **Cost Averaging**: Buys additional units when prices drop below set thresholds  
4. **Cycle Completion**: Repeats process after full position liquidation  

### Parameter Optimization  

#### Purchase Settings  
- Minimum single trade value: 10 USDT  
- Recommended progression: Each subsequent purchase â‰¥ previous amount  

#### Position Management  
- **Interval Setting**: 5% or 10% price drop triggers next purchase  
- **Tracking Activation**: 0.7-1% rebound detection before executing trades  

#### Exit Strategies  
- **Global Exit**: Entire position liquidated at set profit threshold  
- **Partial Exit**: Grid trading activated for trailing profits on recent purchases
