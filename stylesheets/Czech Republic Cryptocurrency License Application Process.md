# Czech Republic Cryptocurrency License Application Process  

## Understanding the Regulatory Landscape  

The Czech Republic currently lacks a specific national regulatory framework for cryptocurrency businesses. However, all crypto-related operations must comply with EU-wide directives, particularly the **5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD5)**, which was implemented in 2018. The Czech National Bank (CNB) oversees this compliance through its publication *"Security of Internet Payments and Cryptocurrencies"*. Importantly, cryptocurrencies are legally classified as commodities rather than currencies in the Czech Republic.  

The country maintains a robust crypto ecosystem, supported by:  
- **Incubator programs** for blockchain startups  
- **Industry associations** fostering collaboration  
- **Active crypto communities** driving innovation  

## License Categories for Crypto Businesses  

To operate legally in the Czech crypto market, businesses must obtain one of four specialized licenses. Each license type governs specific operational parameters:  

| License Type      | Permitted Activities                                  | Key Features                          |  
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|  
| **Classical**      | Cryptocurrency-to-cryptocurrency exchange services    | Enables commission-based crypto swaps  |  
| **Fiat**           | Crypto-to-fiat and fiat-to-crypto conversions         | Requires strict AML/KYC compliance     |  
| **Traditional**    | All currency exchange services (crypto + fiat)        | Most comprehensive operational scope   |  
| **Specialized**    | Wallet creation/storage and key management services   | Focuses on secure crypto infrastructure|
