# Complete Guide to MEXC USDT Perpetual Contracts  

Trading USDT perpetual contracts has become a cornerstone of cryptocurrency derivatives markets, offering traders leverage and flexibility. This guide explores MEXCâ€™s USDT perpetual contract platform, covering essential features, trading strategies, and risk management practices.  

## What Are USDT Perpetual Contracts?  

USDT perpetual contracts are derivative financial instruments pegged to Tether (USDT), a stablecoin tied to the US dollar. These contracts allow traders to speculate on cryptocurrency price movements without owning the underlying asset. Key characteristics include:  
- **Stable settlement**: Profits and losses (PnL) are calculated in USDT, eliminating volatility risks associated with crypto-collateralized contracts.  
- **No expiration date**: Unlike traditional futures, perpetual contracts can be held indefinitely, making them ideal for long-term strategies.  
- **Leverage**: Amplify exposure with adjustable leverage (1xâ€“500x on MEXC).

### 3. Margin Mode Selection

5. **Maker-Only Orders**: Ensures your order adds liquidity (no immediate execution).  

### 6. Executing Trades

- **Go Short**: Click "Sell" to capitalize on price declines.

High leverage increases both gains and losses. Use conservative leverage (5xâ€“20x) for long-term stability.
