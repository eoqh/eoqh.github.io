# Bitcoin Price Charts: Daily, Weekly, Monthly, and Yearly Analysis

## Understanding Bitcoin Price Charts

Bitcoin price charts provide critical insights into the cryptocurrency's market performance. These charts display the mid-market exchange rate derived from real-time trading data across global exchanges. However, actual buy/sell prices often differ from this midpoint due to spreads and platform-specific fees. 

For instance, the bid-ask spread—the difference between the highest price buyers are willing to pay and the lowest price sellers will accept—directly impacts transaction costs. Platforms like OKX incorporate these market dynamics into their pricing structures.
