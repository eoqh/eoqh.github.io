# Bitstamp Strengthens Global Reach with Singapore MAS License

## Expanding Global Compliance and Trust

Bitstamp, a leading cryptocurrency exchange owned by Robinhood, has recently secured a Major Payment Institution (MPI) license from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). This milestone marks a significant step in Bitstamp's strategy to expand its global footprint while reinforcing its commitment to regulatory compliance and user security. The MAS license not only legitimizes Bitstamp's operations in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region but also positions the exchange as a bridge connecting APAC traders to major crypto markets in the United States, United Kingdom, and European Union.

### Key Highlights of Bitstamp's Expansion

## Bitstamp's Commitment to Secure and Compliant Crypto Trading
